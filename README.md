# Demand & Supply WorkForce Automation

###### Timeline | 2017-18 (Internship - Dell International Services India Pvt. Ltd.)

During my Winter Internship 2018 with DELL, I got an opportunity to work on an automation tool where I developed a full fledged Windows Desktop application using JavaFX to address the concerned challenges. My project was an Automation tool development for the generation of a consolidated view of Dashboard that includes all required information with rapid report generation, data manipulation and summary invocation. The idea is to mainly reduce prolonged manual effort in every team meeting on the below gatherings:

- Taking Business decisions; 
- Demand & Supply Generation and Maintenance; 
- Programâ€™s progress status and monitoring; 
- Reports and executive summary generation for Presentation; 
- Business needs and requirements demonstration and discussions; 
- Keeping track of every resource under any organization; 
- Understanding relationship among various sectors of workforce; 
- Determining variance of resources for maximizing utilization; 
- Observing modifications over the time to take better business decisions; 
- Providing an ease of access and data at one place for considerations and evaluation.

###### This tool generates mutiple views and has many other complex functionalities integrated. Due to company privacy and NDA, just showcasing the overview look of the working tool.

## Methodology

This Automation tool is a Java based Windows Desktop Application built using JavaFX and FXML technologies on the Eclipse IDE. Microsoft Excel is being used as an Input source of data for the tool. In the organisations, resource data is contained in the Excel sheets which is being inserted in the tool and then based on the provided data, this tool generates different consolidated views for the review by the business team. The generated output can also be exported and stored in excel documents.
